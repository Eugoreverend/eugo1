                        <strong>Dear Trishyy.</strong>
                        <p>
                           I know we won't be able to see each other for a while due to the break, I'll miss you throughout the break. The past few months we're great and it became greater ever since i got to know you and eventually the spark that i've always had eventually became more than just a spark.
                           I'm always here for you if you ever need anything as long as it's within my ability to do so. stay safe and take care always.

                            Patiently yours,

                            Eugo.
